1. Average latencies only give us a view into the average performance of a system.  However, to get a clearer picture of how a system is performing during high load times, we need to look at percentile latencies.  Performance issues can be hidden away, and simply looking at the average latency doesn't give a clear picture of how the system is performing under various amounts of load.  Looking at multiple different percentiles is a quick and easy way to get a really solid idea of how a system is performing.

2. Some of the mtrics that are useful to track for a queuing service are latencies for both consumers and producers, overall throughput, total number of messages, and the oldest message.  The latencies give a window into any bottlenecks that may exist on either end of the queue.  If one group, producers or consumers, are experiencing high latencies, this can be indicative of a problem with that group and provide insight to help fix it.  The overall throughput gives an indication of the overall health and load on the queue.  A significant drop in throughput during a time of high expected load could indicate a deeper issue.  The total number of messages in the queue gives an overall view of queue health, and can show if messages are being consumed or produced faster than the other can be used to find performance issues with either.  Lastly, tracking the age of the oldest message in the queue is very useful for identifying serious problems, especially in time sensitive scenarios.
